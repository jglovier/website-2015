Building a product that lots of people use and enjoy is awesome. But building a platform that other people can build things for is really awesome.

GitHub is not just a software product, it is a platform with a robust and growing ecosystem of integrators who are building their own amazing things to serve GitHub customers.

But how do you make a robust integrator ecosystem even better? You give integrators a way to put more of the value they are creating for your customers directly into your product.

And that's the motivation behind our [recently released Checks feature](#).
