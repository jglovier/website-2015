<p>Religion puts God in my debt when I adhere to required standards of behavior and makes me an idolator by putting the things I am trying to get from God above God Himself in my affections.</p>

<p>Faith acknowledges that God is the supreme ruler of all thing, and can never be in my debt. But because He gives me freely favor which I have never deserved, generates gratitude and adoration for Him as I respond with thanksgiving to His grace.</p>
