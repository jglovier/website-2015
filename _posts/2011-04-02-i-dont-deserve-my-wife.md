title: I don't deserve my wife
categories: life
---

<p>I have an amazing wife, in many ways and I love her deeply. She just proved how amazing she is yet again, and that I really don't deserve this woman.</p>

<p>So I have been wanting an iPhone for a long time, but have been patiently enduring a piece of crap Motorola Q9C for about 2 1/2 years since I just couldn't spring for the cost of one, or the data plan (got the Q handset free from Verizon FWIW).</p>

<p>But I decided that this year, at some point, I'm finally going to make the upgrade for several reasons. Some practical, some just out of being fed up with a poor user experience.</p>

<p>Now my wife is not the type to shop excessively - in fact she's quite the opposite. She is very frugal, and wears stuff out before buying new stuff. And she is long overdue for some new summer clothes (literally). Just a couple weeks ago she was saying she thinks she really needs some new items for this summer now especially since she's pregnant.</p>

<p>Although she knows she can buy whatever she needs from the household account as long as we have money, so often resists using our household money out of frugality. (Part of why I love the heck out of her.) So I told her if she needs new clothes not to worry about it because I have a few hundred bucks saved in my business account and I'd be happy to treat her so we don't have to spend household funds.</p>

<p>She was thrilled, and made me feel like a million bucks.</p>

<p>Fast forward to this week...I went out of town on business for a few days. While I was away she told me she had a surprise for me when she returned. I was happy to hear it, but didn't think much of it.</p>

<p>So I got home at 3 am this morning and consequently we didn't see each other until this evening. She was pretty pumped to give me my surprise, and she goes out to her car and brings in a Victoria Secret bag....ooh la la...(don't worry, this story is G rated).</p>

<p>She said, "There's a few things in the bag, so just reach in and grab one." </p>

<p>To my surprise there was no sexy lingerie in the bag, but what I discovered was an iPhone 4, a <a href="http://cure.org">CURE</a> lime green bumper cover, and a pair of BOSE in-ear headphones! I could hardly believe it. It's not even Christmas.</p>

<p>Here she had been inspired by my friend Joel W's gift to his wife for her birthday just a few days ago and had been scheming with my best friend Nick to plan this for me - a complete surprise.</p>

<p>And turns out she didn't even use my business money on herself - she used it to buy me this gift!!</p>

<p>I just had to write a post to brag on my wife a little. A good woman deserves to be bragged on, and clearly my girl is that woman.</p>

<p><blockquote>
Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; <br />but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.

- Proverbs 31:30</p>

<p><em>And for the record, she's going to get her summer clothes. ;-)</p>
