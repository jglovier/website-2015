<p>Have an iPhone 4, or 3G, or ANY iPhone with an unresponsive home button? I do. Lately I've been frustrated that when I hit the "home" button on my iPhone, it would take 4 or 5 tries until it actually responded. SO annoying.</p>

<p>So I did a quick Google search and found out, much to my surprise, that most of the time it IS NOT a hardware problem, it is a software problem that is easily resolved by "recalibrating" your home button.</p>

<p>Sounds like a joke, right? Nope, this really worked for me, and apparently tons more people. Here's all you've got to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open an Apple iOS system app, like Clock, or Calendar, etc.</li>
<li>Hold down your phone's power button (on the top edge) until the "Power Off" slider appears.</li>
<li>Hold down the Home Button for 6 or 7 seconds until the "Power Off" slider disappears and the app force closes, returning you to the home screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! Now you should notice your Home Button being much more responsive, just like when it was new. If not, you may have a hardware issue and need to take it to an Apple store for repair, or use <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-home-button-working-fix/">this workaround</a> to not have to use your home button at all.</p>
