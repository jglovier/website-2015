<p>I recently upgraded to OSX Lion - and by recently I mean several weeks ago. But ever since one thing has really been bugging me: the lack of my handy thumbnail/icon zoom slider in Finder!</p>

<p>Some people may not miss it, but I used it all the time to blow up thumbnails of pictures for getting a better view, then reducing the icons back to manageable size while simply browsing files.</p>

<p>So you can imagine what a pain it seemed to be that my zoom slider had been removed with OSX Lion.</p>

<p>...and you can probably imaging my relief to find that it had not actually been removed, but hidden. YES, you can re-enable it quite easily.</p>

<p>Simply go to Finder > View > Show Status Bar and voila! You'll see your handy thumbnail size toggle slider once again!</p>
