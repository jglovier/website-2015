<h3>My Dad</h3>

<p>The man you see here is my dad. He is one amazing guy. Let me tell you just a little bit about him, and why I love him so much.</p>

<p>My dad was a chemist for most of his life. He worked 26 years for Gulf Oil R&D, and then another decade for Allegheny Energy, where he was laid off in '95. After that, he drove a school bus until he was 73.</p>

<p>My dad just turned 80 a few weeks ago, and he's just as lively as I ever remember him being. Until we moved out of the area just a few weeks ago, he came over weekly to play with my little girls.</p>

<p>My dad was 48 when he met my mom, and 50 when I was born. I've always known him as "older" than other dads, but to me just as young as myself. He and I get along really well - at least since I've left the teenage years.</p>

<p>One of the things I love most about my dad is that he's a very gentle person, and he absolutely loves Jesus. His heart is always about trusting in God, and praying for and helping others.</p>

<p>Happy Veteran's Day to my Dad, who served in the US Army during the Korean War, and to all of the Vets out there who have selflessly served our country to play a part in the freedom we enjoy today.</p>
