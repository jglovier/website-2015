title: QR Codes - Here to stay?
categories: marketing
---

<p>QR codes are everywhere now. Not literally, but almost. Consider the following examples...</p>

<ul>
<li>USA Today and Eastbay catalog (actually these guys are using the Microsoft version)</li>
<li>a recent conference handbook</li>
<li>ads and articles in Wired magazine and Fast Company</li>
<li>LED displayboards in Times Square etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The big question is: are they here to stay?</p>

<p>What I mean is, are they popular because people are using them, or are they popular because marketing folks think people are using them (or WANT people to use them)?</p>

<p>For example, I see them in maybe 60 - 80% of ads I see now days, but I only see them in 10 - 20% of publication articles. Is it that the advertisers know something publishers don't? Or is that the advertisers want to create a reality that the publishers know isn't the case yet.</p>

<p>I suppose it kinda comes down to a chicken or egg discussion, but what I'm really after is - are they here to stay, or are the going to got he way of the slap bracelet?</p>
