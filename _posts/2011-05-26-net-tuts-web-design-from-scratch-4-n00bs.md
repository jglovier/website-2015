Are you brand new to web development? Can you believe that lot's of people pick up web development without ever having gone to school or received formal education in the field? Maybe even the majority?...I dunno. But lot's of people are self taught.

I learned on my own from reading a wonderful book called <a href="http://amzn.to/hzs4BG" target="_blank">Learning Web Design" by Jennifer Robbins</a> and reading lots of web tutorials. But I'm more of a book learner, so that went down well for me. Some people aren't so much book learners.

One of the tutorial sites that really helped me get a grasp on web design is the TutsPlus network from Envato - specifically <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">Net Tuts</a>.

I just noticed they put out a <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/sessions/web-design-from-scratch/" target="_blank">brand new series for beginners</a> on starting with the basics of web development.
