<p>This looks awesome. So apparently you can sit under one on one mentoring and also a classroom setting (20 students max) for a few days in a luxurious cabin in the mountains of Tennessee with Eric Meyer and Aaron Gustafson!</p>

<p>Sadly, they only seem to offer the retreat once a year. Next year I'm all in.</p>
