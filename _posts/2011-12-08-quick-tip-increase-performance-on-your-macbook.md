<p>So I work from two machines on an ongoing basis:<p>
<ul>
<li>a Mid 2010 15" Macbook Pro with 8GB of Ram and a i7 Dual Core processor</li>
<li>a Late 2009 Mac Pro tower with dual Quad-Core processors, and 16GB of RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>The Macbook I use in the office at CURE, and when traveling, and the tower I use at my home office. I typically have to do any heavy lifting (ie print design and web designs with more than 200 - 300 photoshop layers) on my tower.</p>

<p>But there's plenty of times when I'm in the office and I just can't get to the tower, so I have to make do on heavy lifting with my Macbook.</p>

<p>It craps the bed plenty.</p>

<p>If I have a large file open in Photoshop, and InDesign and Illustrator open (which I almost always do), as well as a handful of other applications, the machine will become all but unresponsive.</p>

<p>Now I've proven that I'm clearly on the extreme end of power computing use-cases. I've even had issues escalate to Apple's engineering department (when four Applecare advisors and a Sr. Applecare Advisor have been stumped by my issue).</p>

<p>But recently I had a little glimmer of hope when a friend gave me this tip. If you need more processing power on your Macbook, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences (Apple > System Preferences...)</li>
<li>Under "Hardware" category, select Energy Saver.</li>
<li>At the top of the dialogue box, make sure that "Automatic graphics switching" is disabled.</li>
</ol>

<p>Changing this setting means that your machine will always operate at maximum graphics performance, although it will drain your battery life a little faster. For me, it's worth the trade off by far - especially since I normally have my machine plugged in throughout the day.</p>
