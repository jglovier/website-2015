<p>I just got my first iPhone a few months ago: a shiny new iPhone 4. I love it (about as much as you can love a device).</p>

<p>But before that, I had an iPod touch. I was also pretty fond of it. :-)</p>

<p>Fortunately, the lovely people over at Apple made it really easy to transfer all your settings from an old iOS device when you get a new one. And that&#8217;s exactly what I did through iTunes when I got my new iPhone.</p>

<p>One thing I did not realize, however, was that my new iOS would even inherit it&#8217;s name from my old one. That left me seeing &#8220;JAG iPod Touch&#8221; in iTunes every time I plugged in the phone. That was a little annoying.</p>

<p>I tried to change it for the longest time by hunting through the iTunes interface and options. But it wasn&#8217;t until I finally decided to stop at the gas station and ask for directions (and by that of course I mean &#8220;Google it&#8221;) that I found the answer.</p>

<p>All you have to do to rename an iOS device through iTunes is double click it&#8217;s name in the left hand sidebar.</p>

<p>Now wasn&#8217;t that easy?</p>
