<p>So everyone thinks different things about social media. <em>(For the unenlightened, I'm referring to Facebook and Twitter, as the most popular examples, and then a huge myriad variety of other "social" sites where users have a profile, connect with one another, and talk about - well - themselves).</em></p>

<p>And the common complaint from people about "social media" that I hear is something along the lines of,</p>

<blockquote>
"That stuff is just so much about self promotion. It all just seems so narcissistic."</blockquote>

<p>Or in <span class="strikethrough">other words</span> my words,</p>

<blockquote>
"People who use social media are mostly duchebags."
</blockquote>

<p>*NOTE: for the record, most of the time the term "social media duchebags" derrogatorially refers to a whole catagory of business professionals who make their living out of advising people in the realm of social media - some are legit and some are definitely - well - duchebags ("snake oil salesmen" is also acceptable).</p>

<p>So I regularly use social media. And I also don't consider myself a duchebag - or at least not for those reasons. The whole point about social media being very self-centered is a very mute point in my opinion. Here's why:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<h3>"Social media" doesn't do anything that people don't do.</h3>
<p>All social media outles are is an arena, a context, a microphone, a platform. So people aren't really doing anything with social media that they aren't already doing period. It's just making the stuff people do, say, think, etc. more accessible to more people.</p>
<p>So if you are a duchebag in real life, you are a duchebag on social media. It's just a microphone for your personality. If you are self-centered offline in your interactions with others, you will be just the same way online. Don't blame social media for that.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>There are plenty of good use cases for social media that have nothing to do with personal life details.</h3>
<p>From a marketing and business perspective, I can say I've seen a ton of really great stuff from social media. Some good examples are:
<ul>
<li>Starbucks, Old Spice and other high profile companies using Twitter as a very personal way to engage customers;</li>
<li>celebrities and other high profile personalities using Twitter as a way to show their more human side (or not);</li>
<li>social media being used to transform traditional media outlets as a source of news and information, and</li>
<li>connections restored with long lost peers, family and friends, and new connections quickly built through social outlets.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Being honest, this point is very secondary to my first point, which I think is the main one. In fact, I just thought of these examples because as my wife likes to say, "I always have to have three points"...but wait, this is only two...haha - she is wrong for once!! Anyway...</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>So all this to say, before we go bashing social media, or waiting for it to just be a trend that fades into the blue, let's consider that it is after all, just a tool.</p>

<p>Respect the tool. Don't be a duchebag.</p>
