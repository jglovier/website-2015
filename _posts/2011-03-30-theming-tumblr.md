<p class="disclaimer">EDIT: This blog is no longer on Tumblr. I've moved to a static Jekyll powered site for the blog.</p>

<p>OK, so a few days ago I set out to setup a Tumblr for my new blog.</p>&#13;
<p>I really did so just to get a better idea of why so many people are using Tumblr these days, and because it seemed like a pretty straightforward way to blog for a change. (As opposed to a fairly extensive setup process for a Wordpress install.)</p>&#13;
<p>Don't get me wrong - I'm a pretty big Wordpress fan. But I'm more of a fan of Wordpress as a CMS. For a blog it's still great, too. I mean it really is actually just blogging software afterall.</p>&#13;
<p>But I'm really starting to appreciate the simplicity of Tumblr. Even theming is really simple - mostly. :-)</p>&#13;
<p>To theme a tumblog you just upload one HTML file with some markup and custom Tumlr markup. There's a learning curve (which you might see right now if you check this page in firefox!), but overall it's pretty straightforward, and I'm really starting to like Tumblr.</p>
