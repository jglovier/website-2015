<p>Ever wonder how to turn on caps lock on your iPhone? If you're like me, sometimes you want to type a whole word in capitals - or several words - and tapping the shift arrow before every letter can become annoying.</p>

<p>Well there's a way to turn on caps lock while you're typing, but you have to enable it from iOS settings first. Here's the path:</p>

<pre><code>
Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Enable Caps Lock.
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you are typing with the keyboard, you can double-tap the shift arrow and it will stay on capitals.</p>

<p>Boom. Happy mobile typing. </p>
