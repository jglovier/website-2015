<blockquote>
<p>He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.<p>
<p class="citation reference">- Colossians 1:13-14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...a wonderful reminder that in Christ we have <q>"the forgiveness of sins"</q>, and that it was not <em>cheap grace</em>, but purchased by the blood of the Son of God.</p>

<p>How quickly we take for granted the significance of this truth: <q><em>the forgiveness of sins</em><q>. Especially growing up in church and being around those who possess the same grace, it's easy to forget that grace comes with a price - a price paid not by the recipient, but by the giver.</p>

<p>Oh that God would grant us to daily recall, cherish, and absorb the weight and significance of such an amazing and costly grace. A grace that was paid for by the blood of the perfect Son of God.</p>
