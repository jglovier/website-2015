Stumbled across this script today (I think <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mozilla">Mozilla</a> tweeted it) and it looks like something with huge potential.

The short explanation is that this script allows you to manipulate objects in your HTML page live based on cues from a video's timeline.

For example, if you have specific content that you want to display beside a video, you can bind that content to key points in the video.

I can picture a ton of uses where this makes for a really compelling landing page, or even just a very helpful resource. For example, lets say you have a recording of somebody giving a talk, and beside the video of the talk, you want to display slides from a slideshow in real time as the talk video is playing. Done.

What would you do with a script like this?
