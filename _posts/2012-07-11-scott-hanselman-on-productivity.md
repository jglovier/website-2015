<p>Wow. This is a brilliant. Scott Hanselman speaking at Webstock '12 talks about productivity, and it's not all the 7 habits type  stuff, it's really practical things that hit home with me because Scott Hanselman is a developer with similar work habits that I have.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite quotes from the presentation are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The optimal number of threads in any system is one. This includes humans."</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>What is wrong with you people and your 42 tabs?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Start dropping the ball.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Things come into our lives...and they need to be triaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...oh yeah, and this one...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me the iPhone has completely changed the way that I poop.</p>
