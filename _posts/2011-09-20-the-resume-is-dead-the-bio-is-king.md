<p>Great advice for all of us professionals - whether you're looking for a job or not. The great thing about the web is that it lets us connect with anyone.</p>

<p>That's the point behind "the Bio" as a format for a resume. The point of a bio is to put yourself out there in a personable format to connect with.</p>

<p>I love this trend, mostly because so much of life is about relationships, especially when it comes to your work. So it makes so much sense that when we meet people for business we should view those as relationships just the same as other's in life. </p>
